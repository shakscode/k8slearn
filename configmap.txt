in configmap we can define values in key value pair or even a lines of file.

in pod under spec , we put env and wrtie configmapref and refer the configmap and the key in that.
configmapkeyref is how pod refers to tag the configmap.

drawback.
cant refresh on its own.


1. data :

  #key:value
  #nginx.conf(filename) | "xx
  xxxx"
  
  
 2. also configmap can be mapped as mountpath.
 
 step 1. decalre a configmap as with a file content, multiple files also can be referred.
 
 
 step.
 
 in specs of container, mention a volume mount and refer that to volume.
 
 in the same volume, refer to the configmap.
 
 
 eg:
 
  volumemount
    name: nginx
    mountpath: /etc/nginx
    
 volumes:
    -name: nginx
    configmap:
     name: nginx (name of configmap decalred in configmapfile
     
     (above snippet, volume is a configmap itself.)
     
     
now the configmap files will be available under /etc/nginx
